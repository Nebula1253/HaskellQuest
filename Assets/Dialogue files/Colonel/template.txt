Oh, hi there! Are you in charge of this place?

Don't play clueless, kid! You may have trashed those worthless soldiers, but you're not gettin' past me!
I'm an ENLISTED man, dagnabbit, and I take that duty seriously!

Ah, and I guess that duty includes targeting innocent civilians and trashing countless homes, does it? How <i>honourable<i> of you.
...wait a second, did you say en-LIST-ed? Oh, <i>brother<i>...

Hrgh... let's see how cocky you get when I point these missile launchers atcha, you brat!




Sorry, were you saying something about pointing missile launchers at me? How's that faring for you?
Hmm... you're looking a bit grotesque there. Was that the missiles, or were you just built that way?

NNGGHH! Just for that, you're gonna PAY!



Just give it up, Colonel! You look like you're on the verge of flying apart!

No! NO! I'm not losing to the likes of YOU! I'M GONNA TEAR YOU APART IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO!
