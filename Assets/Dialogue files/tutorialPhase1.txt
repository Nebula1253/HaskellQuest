Good job! Now, let's move on and talk about <i>lists</i> and <i>tuples</i>.
Lists and tuples are Haskell's fundamental structures for managing multiple values.
You might be familiar with them if you've used something like Python before, but let's recap.
Lists, bounded by '[' and ']' store multiple values of the same type, and are freely extensible i.e. there's no limit to the number of elements.
Tuples, meanwhile, are bounded by '(' and ')', and can store values of different types, but you can't add more elements to them once declared.
Since lists and tuples are distinct types, lists can contain lists, tuples can contain tuples, lists can contain tuples and vice versa.
A note: Haskell does have a String type, but that's basically an alias for a list of Chars.
