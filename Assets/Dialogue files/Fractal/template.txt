Dr. Kowalewski?

Doctor who? I don't recognise anyone with that name here.
There's only... a Fractal left...

What happened to you?

I... was experimenting... Do you know of the legend of the Lambda Gauntlet, of how it could alter reality?

...I might be familiar, yeah.

I was trying to recreate it, to understand its technology. I was experimenting with recursion... and...
....it's difficult to think.... it's like, every thought I have, it echoes and echoes and gets louder and LOUDER and <i>LOUDER</i> until...

I think I understand, Doctor. But... I need to ask. There were some kidnappings and...

Kidnappings? No, no, no, those were colleagues! Volunteers! 
They were trying to help, to undo what I'd done to myself...
And it's all gone wrong... I can't fix it... it's all useless... 
I just want to be left alone.

I'm afraid I can't do that, Doctor.

What do you mean...? Are you going to hurt me...?

What? No! I don't...

No, NO, NO! GET AWAY! I'LL KILL YOU!





I'm really sorry about that, Doctor, but it was all I could think of to stop you.

That... that thing on your right hand... is that...?

Yes, it is. It's the Lambda Gauntlet.
Don't you see, I can help you, please just let me!



Wait, I can feel it... something's happening!

I'm... I'm me again! Oh, my head... I can think again!
Thank you, thank you so much!

Of course, Doctor. I think I can help your friends too, if they're in your lab somewhere.
