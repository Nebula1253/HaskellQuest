Man, this place has been trashed...
--- SWITCH ---
Dr. Kowalewski?
--- SWITCH ---
Doctor who? I don't recognise anyone with that name here.
There's only... a Fractal left...
--- SWITCH ---
A Fractal? What does that mean?
--- SWITCH ---
What happened to you?
--- SWITCH ---
I... was experimenting... Do you know of the legend of the Lambda Gauntlet, of how it could alter reality?
--- SWITCH ---
...we might be familiar, yeah.
--- SWITCH ---
Oh no... you weren't trying to recreate it, were you?
--- SWITCH ---
I was trying to understand its technology. I was experimenting with recursion... and...
....it's difficult to think.... it's like, every thought I have, it echoes and echoes and gets louder and LOUDER and <i>LOUDER</i> until...
--- SWITCH ---
I think I understand, Doctor. But... we need to ask.
--- SWITCH ---
There were some kidnappings and...
--- SWITCH ---
Kidnappings? No, no, no, those were colleagues! Volunteers! 
They were trying to help, to undo what I'd done to myself...
And it's all gone wrong... I can't fix it... it's all useless... 
I just want to be left alone.
--- SWITCH ---
I'm afraid we can't do that, Doctor.
--- SWITCH ---
Your power is too dangerous for you to be left like this.
--- SWITCH ---
What do you mean...? Are you two going to hurt me...?
--- SWITCH ---
What? No! I don't...
--- SWITCH ---
We just want to help!
--- SWITCH ---
No, NO, NO! GET AWAY! I'LL KILL YOU!
