What... what is this place? What's happening?
This armor, it's just latched onto me!
--- SWITCH ---
Hey, relax. You've managed to stumble into the Lambda Cave. You've been granted... a great power, to say the least.
--- SWITCH ---
The Lambda Cave...? But, doesn't that make you...?
--- SWITCH ---
Yes. I am... what remains of... LAMBDA-MAN, famed hero and bastion of functional programming.
In... the final battle, I was greatly injured. What you see now is just a hologram; my body heals in the chamber beneath.
--- SWITCH ---
We all thought you died! The world's been going to hell! It's swarmed by selfish idiots misusing Haskell's power!
--- SWITCH ---
Yes. That is why you must take over as the new LAMBDA-MAN.
The armor that chose you, it's the new LAMBDA SUIT.
It's mostly protective, though; the real highlight is the LAMBDA GAUNTLET, on your right arm.
--- SWITCH ---
The Lambda Gauntlet? What does it do?
--- SWITCH ---
It's advanced science, so advanced it's almost magic.
It allows you to access the Haskell code of your adversaries, and, most importantly, <i>change</i> that code.
It can save your life; it's saved mine on many occasions.
--- SWITCH ---
That's incredible! Are you sure you trust me with this power?
--- SWITCH ---
I have little choice... but I can help prepare you.
In all the challenges to come, one thing will be true.
Your adversaries will try to attack you, and you'll have to write Haskell to deflect that attack.
What better way to help you prepare than attacking you myself?
--- SWITCH ---
Wait, <i>what</i>?!
--- SWITCH ---
No, no, don't worry! It's quite a simple attack to deflect. It'll help you get used to using the Gauntlet.
Plus, if you do get hurt, I'll heal you once you've succeeded.
--- SWITCH ---
But I don't know the first thing about writing Haskell!
--- SWITCH ---
Your suit has an internal database; it can store Haskell information for you to look up at any time.
I've just uploaded the information to do with types, expressions, functions and pattern-matching.
Also, in case you do make a mistake in your code, you can look at the errors at any time too.
--- SWITCH ---
I guess that'll have to do... Alright. Bring it!
