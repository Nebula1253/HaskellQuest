...yeah, pretty much.
I didn't mention earlier: Haskell has a 'String' type, but that's basically an alias for '[Char]', so these operators apply there too.
Tuples, meanwhile, are bounded by '(' and ')', and can store values of different types, but you can't add more elements to them once declared.
Since lists and tuples are distinct types, lists can contain lists, tuples can contain tuples, lists can contain tuples and vice versa.
