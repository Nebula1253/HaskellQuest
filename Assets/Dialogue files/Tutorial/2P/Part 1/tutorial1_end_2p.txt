Yeah! These gauntlets are really powerful...
--- SWITCH ---
Good job, you two! Let me heal you up again.
Now, we should move to rec.... hold on.
--- SWITCH ---
What? Has something happened?
--- SWITCH ---
Oh no... someone's attacking the city right now, aren't they?
--- SWITCH ---
Yes. And it's big trouble.
COLONEL TRIGGER-FINGER and his Thunder Squadron are heading there in their warships.
--- SWITCH ---
Those scoundrels! They've been a plague for years!
--- SWITCH ---
I can't wait to give them what they've got coming!
--- SWITCH ---
We can pick this up later... I think you're ready to take them on.
--- SWITCH ---
What, really?
--- SWITCH ---
So soon after we started?
--- SWITCH ---
Yes. I believe in you both. You can do this!
Go forth, LAMBDA-MEN! Be the Purely-Functional Duo this world needs!
