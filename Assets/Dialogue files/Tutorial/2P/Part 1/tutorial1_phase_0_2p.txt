What... what is this place? What's happening?
--- SWITCH ---
These suits, they've just latched onto us!
--- SWITCH ---
Hey, relax. You've both managed to stumble into the Lambda Cave. You've been granted... a great power, to say the least.
--- SWITCH ---
The Lambda Cave...? 
--- SWITCH ---
But, doesn't that make you...?
--- SWITCH ---
Yes. I am... what remains of... LAMBDA-MAN, famed hero and bastion of functional programming.
In... the final battle, I was greatly injured. What you see now is just a hologram; my body heals in the chamber beneath.
--- SWITCH ---
We all thought you died! The world's been going to hell! 
--- SWITCH ---
It's been overrun by selfish idiots misusing Haskell's power!
--- SWITCH ---
Yes. That is why you two must take over as the new LAMBDA-MEN.
You've both been chosen by the new LAMBDA SUITS.
They're mostly protective, though; the real highlights are the LAMBDA GAUNTLETS, on your right arms.
--- SWITCH ---
The Lambda Gauntlet? What does it do?
--- SWITCH ---
Seems like some sort of code interface...
--- SWITCH ---
It's advanced science, so advanced it's almost magic.
It allows you to access the Haskell code of your adversaries, and, most importantly, <i>change</i> that code.
It can save your lives; it's saved mine on many occasions.
The two gauntlets are linked - you can, at any time, see what code the other is working on.
--- SWITCH ---
That's incredible! Are you sure you trust us with this power?
--- SWITCH ---
Yeah... you've basically just met us, and that was complete chance.
--- SWITCH ---
I have little choice... but I can help prepare you.
In all the challenges to come, one thing will be true.
Your adversaries will try to attack you, and you'll have to write Haskell to deflect that attack.
Their attacks are smarter and more dangerous than in my day, and you'll both have to work together to win.
So... what better way to help you prepare than attacking you myself?
--- SWITCH ---
Wait, <i>what</i>?!
--- SWITCH ---
That's insane!
--- SWITCH ---
No, no, don't worry! It's quite a simple attack to deflect. It'll help you get used to using the Gauntlets.
Plus, if you two do get hurt, I'll heal you once you've succeeded.
--- SWITCH ---
But... we've never written Haskell before?
--- SWITCH ---
How can you be so sure we're up to this?
--- SWITCH ---
Your suits have an internal database; you can look up Haskell information at any time.
I've just uploaded the information to do with types, expressions, functions and pattern-matching.
Also, in case you do make a mistake in your code, you can look at the errors at any time too.
--- SWITCH ---
I guess that'll have to do... 
--- SWITCH ---
Alright. Bring it!
