Yeah, or a <i>guard</i>: it's an expression evaluating to a Bool used to filter the elements of the list.
You can have multiple generators. This'd be an acceptable list comprehension, for example: [(i,j) | i <- [1,2,3], j <- [1,2]]
With that though, the result would be [(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)...]; the second generator has priority.
