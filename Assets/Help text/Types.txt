Types are how Haskell describes data. 

Haskell's standard types include:
1) Int: an integer within the range -2<sup>29</sup> to (2<sup>29</sup> - 1), and Integer: an unbounded integer
2) Float: a floating-point number, and Double: a double-precision float
3) Char: a single character (e.g. 'a', '1', '$')
4) Bool: either True or False

There are two type-related keywords in Haskell:

1) The 'type' keyword just defines a type as an alias for another type - a 'type synonym'. For instance:

    type Temp = Float 
    
This means you can treat 'Temp' and 'Float' interchangeably. Haskell's string type is defined as an alias for a list of Chars.

2) The 'data' keyword is used to declare an entirely new type. For instance:

    data Shape = Circle Float Float Float | Rectangle Float Float Float Float

'Circle' and 'Rectangle' are both <i>data constructors</i>. The '|' character allows you to declare multiple constructors for a type. 
These constructors act as functions that return a value of type Shape.
