List comprehensions allow you to create a list based on the elements of another list.

Generating a list with all the even numbers from 1 to 5 would look like this:

    [x | x <- [1..50], x `mod` 2 == 0]

Here, 'x <- [1..50]' is a <i>generator</i>: it feeds each element to the expression before the '|'. 
'x `mod` 2 == 0' is a <i>guard</i>: a Bool expression used to filter the elements of the list.

You can use multiple generators in a list comprehension. For example:

    [(i,j) | i <- ['a','b'], j <- [1,2]]

This expression evaluates out to:

    [(a,1),(a,2),(b,1),(b,2)]

Importantly, 'j' fully iterates through the second list before 'i' moves on to the next element of the first list.

To iterate through both lists <i>simultaneously</i>, the 'zip' function takes two lists and returns a list of tuples. For instance, the expression:

    zip [1,2,3] [1,2]

...returns the list [(1, 1), (2, 2)]. The longer list is truncated to match the length of the shorter one. 

This list can then be used in a list comprehension. For instance, if you want the sum of two lists of ints:

    [ i + j | (i, j) <- zip [1,2,3] [1,2] ]

Haskell also supports <i>parallel</i> list comprehension, which supports more intuitive syntax for the same operation:

    [ i + j | i <- [1,2,3] | j <- [1,2] ]
