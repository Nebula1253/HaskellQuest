And so, a new light dawned upon the world: the return of LAMBDA-MAN!
His first mission: taking down the Thunder Squadron, an elite group of robotic mercenaries working for the highest bidder.
The Squadron was solely comprised of the "best of the best": ruthless butchers and warmongers.
The new Lambda-Man, eager to prove himself, snuck aboard their airship before it took off, handily defeating most of the rank-and-file soldiers.
We join our hero now, high in the skies, as he faces off against the leader of the Squadron: the monstrous (and aptly-named) COLONEL TRIGGER-FINGER!
