A tranquil night sky settles upon the troubled landscape of HASKELL CITY...
Years ago, the beloved hero LAMBDA-MAN disappeared in an epic battle to end all battles.
Since then, his existence has faded into myth and legend.
The city, meanwhile, descended into chaos and lawlessness, as malcontents swarmed her streets. 
Taking advantage of the power of HASKELL, the world's lifeblood, they schemed and plotted and waged war.
Haskell City's halcyon days were far, far behind her... but as we shall soon see, perhaps they can return.
For at this very moment, an adventurous youth exploring a cave system blunders into something that would change his life forever...
