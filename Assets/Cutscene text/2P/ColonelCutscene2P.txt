And so, a new light dawns upon the world: the LAMBDA-MEN!
Their first mission: taking down the Thunder Squadron, an elite group of robotic mercenaries working for the highest bidder.
The Squadron was solely comprised of the "best of the best": ruthless butchers and warmongers.
The Purely Functional Duo, eager to prove themselves, snuck aboard their airship before it took off, handily defeating most of the rank-and-file soldiers.
We join our heroes now, high in the skies, as they face off against the leader of the Squadron: the monstrous (and aptly-named) COLONEL TRIGGER-FINGER!
